# Boson Protocol Improvement Proposals (BPIPs)

Anyone can suggest and lead a change in Boson Protocol's technological stack through Boson Protocol Improvement Proposals (pronounced _bee-pips_). We follow a simple process that is common in web3, as described below. We welcome suggestions for tweaking it further.

The BPIP process is described in the [BPIP-1](./content/BPIP-1.md) document, please follow the steps there. Before putting in the work and creating a new proposal, it is preferred to initiate a discussion with the community in Boson Protocol's Discord channel at https://discord.com/channels/811155042714779678/922532540416421918.

Boson Protocol Improvement Proposals offer a path for contributing to Boson Protocol in an open and standardized way and cover three main aspects:
* smart contracts layer
* SDK and widgets
* and parameters of the protocol itself.

As these are vastly different changes, the process for each is a bit different. We are looking into automating it and further decentralize all the operations in a progressive way. Last but not least, check our Grants page for funding your project at: https://bosonprotocol.io/build/
